## 7. Sales Analysis Q&A

**1. Why does São Paulo have much higher sales than other states?**  
São Paulo has a larger population, more sellers, faster delivery, and a stronger online retail culture. Other states may have weaker logistics or lower platform awareness.

**2. What makes you say there is room to grow in low-sales states?**  
Many states show low order volume despite large populations. Olist can reach more customers through better marketing, more sellers, or faster delivery.

**3. Recommended actions for low-sales regions:**  
- Increase marketing or local partnerships.  
- Recruit more local sellers.  
- Improve delivery routes to reduce waiting times.  
- Tailor offers to regional product preferences.

**4. How reliable are the seasonal peaks?**  
Patterns repeat across multiple years. Black Friday and Christmas consistently show spikes, making them reliable for planning.

**5. How should Olist use the Black Friday peak?**  
- Build campaigns earlier.  
- Promote popular categories.  
- Support seller stock planning.  
- Improve delivery predictions to avoid delays.

**6. Any risks in the sales data?**  
Yes. Slow delivery in some states lowers review scores, and payment options are concentrated on credit cards, leaving potential revenue untapped.

**7. How did you ensure accuracy?**  
Data cleaning, correct table linking, checking for missing values, and cross-validation across visualisations.

**8. Why do credit cards dominate?**  
They allow instalments, which is preferred by Brazilian customers. Other methods offer less flexibility.

**9. Main takeaway from sales analysis:**  
Sales are strong in key states and during seasonal peaks. Opportunities lie in under-served regions and preparing for high-demand periods.

**10. Data limitations:**  
Dataset ends in 2018. Patterns are clear but current conditions may differ. Still, trends provide useful guidance for strategy.
