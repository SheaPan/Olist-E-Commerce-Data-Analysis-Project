 Above shows a visual representation, of the delivery insights, including a pie chart for Delivery Performance, and a bar chart for Delivery Times by State.       Stores in states like Sao Paulo with larger customer bases and established practices have the shortest delivery times in the lower percentile, however, states      that haven't got established practices, or much smaller customer bases have a correlation with longer delivery times. 


### Relationship Between Delivery Time, Order Value, and Reviews

- Longer deliveries are associated with **lower average review scores**.  
- **Order value** is another factor: higher-value orders tend to take longer to deliver, but their review scores are **not as negatively affected** as lower-value    late orders.
- **Threshold Awareness:**  High value orders have a lesser impact on lower review scores attributed to late delivery, however, there is a threshold where the        value of the order no longer matters if the **delivery is too late**.
  
- Possible explanations:  
  - High-value items require **specialized shipping or handling**.  
  - Larger items (cars, sofas, refrigerators) require **specialized equipment** and cannot be easily automated through delivery processes. 
  - Customers of higher-value items may **expect longer delivery times** and are more tolerant of delays.
  - More **checkpoints and authorization** needed for higher value items, slowing down delivery.
  - Roraima (RR) having the longest average delivery times due to all but one of their stores in located in the captial city, Boa Vista. Delivery to other parts of     the city will take longer.

  The larger bubbles on the bubble chart correlate to a longer delivery age, and the points along the y axis correlate to higher and lower reviews. We can see a      relationship between average delivery times and average review scores. Notably, on the cards, we can the longest average delivery times does not correlate with     the lowest average review scores, so there should be further investigation into this.

  The line graph shows the relationship between average order value, delivery status and review score. The cards beside the graph show the relationship between       avergae order value and delviery status, whichs shows that and the average of value of orders amongst late deliveries is higher than those of early and on time     deliveries.
